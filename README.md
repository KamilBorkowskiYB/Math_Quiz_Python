# Simple math quiz in python using ttkbootstrap

A project written in free time for learning how to build application windows using the ttkbootstrap library for the Python programming language. 

## How the program works
The program is based on asking the user ten mathematical questions for which he will have a limited amount of time.
The program randomly selects operations and numbers of the equations.
After answering all ten questions or the end of the time, the program will display how many correct answers have been given and give the opportunity to retake the quiz.
